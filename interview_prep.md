# Interview Questions & Sample Answers for Whisper Speech-to-Text App Project

---

### 1. **Can you explain how your speech-to-text app works end-to-end?**

**Sample Answer:**
The app records audio from the user's microphone in the browser and sends the audio data to a Flask backend. The backend saves the audio, runs it through OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription, then returns the text result. The frontend displays the latest transcription and maintains a scrollable history. It supports both manual and automatic recording with silence detection to stop recording after 3 seconds of silence.

### 2. **Why did you choose the Whisper model for transcription?**

**Sample Answer:**
Whisper is a powerful open-source automatic speech recognition model from OpenAI that supports multiple languages and has strong robustness to accents and background noise. It provides good accuracy without needing expensive APIs. Since it can be run locally, it gives flexibility for offline transcription, fitting the app’s needs for a self-hosted solution.

### 3. **How did you implement silence detection for automatic recording stop?**

**Sample Answer:**
Silence detection is done by analyzing the audio input's volume amplitude in real-time using the Web Audio API on the frontend. If the input volume remains below a threshold for 3 continuous seconds, the app automatically stops recording and sends the audio for transcription. A countdown timer and progress bar show the user how much time is left before recording stops due to silence.

### 4. **What challenges did you face with real-time transcription using Whisper, and how did you handle them?**

**Sample Answer:**
Whisper is not optimized for low-latency streaming and processes audio chunks in batches, causing delays for real-time transcription. To handle this, I implemented recording in manageable chunks with overlapping buffers, but still relied on post-recording transcription. This tradeoff was necessary given Whisper’s architecture. For truly real-time streaming, other models or APIs might be more suitable.

### 5. **How is audio recorded and processed on the frontend?**

**Sample Answer:**
Audio is recorded using the browser’s MediaRecorder API, capturing audio in WAV format. The app streams the audio into memory, and upon stopping, it packages the audio blob and sends it to the Flask backend via a POST request. The frontend also monitors audio volume to detect silence for auto-stopping recording.

### 6. **What backend technologies and libraries did you use and why?**

**Sample Answer:**
The backend uses Flask as a lightweight web server to handle API requests. Python libraries include OpenAI Whisper for transcription, NumPy for audio data manipulation, and Pydub for audio file processing and conversion. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration with Python-based ML libraries.

### 7. **How do you manage transcription history in your app?**

**Sample Answer:**
Transcription history is stored server-side in memory as a Python list for simplicity. The history is sent to the frontend on each transcription and displayed in a scrollable UI. Users can clear history or export it as a text file. For production, this could be replaced by persistent storage like a database.

### 8. **How do you ensure your app is user-friendly and visually appealing?**

**Sample Answer:**
I integrated Bootstrap for responsive and clean UI styling. The transcription results highlight the latest entry for clarity, and the history section supports scrolling. Buttons are styled and grouped logically. Visual feedback is given during recording with a silence countdown and progress bar to guide users.

---

### 9. **How did you handle the model loading and performance optimization?**

**Sample Answer:**
To avoid re-downloading the Whisper model every time, I downloaded and cached the model locally before the app starts. Model loading occurs once at server startup to reduce latency during transcription requests. Audio chunks are kept short for faster transcription, balancing performance and accuracy.

### 10. **What improvements or future features would you add to your app?**

**Sample Answer:**
Future improvements include adding persistent database storage for transcriptions, supporting real-time streaming transcription with a more suitable model, multi-language UI support, user authentication, and enhanced audio preprocessing for noise reduction. Also, integrating a frontend waveform visualization during recording would improve user experience.
